Please, unless you have updates, I refer you to Motorola's BBS for
information on this and help on using it.  Send flames to /dev/null.

This is a simple assembler for the Motorola 6809.  It is one
of the freeware assemblers on their BBS with minor mods for Linux.

To build:

   gcc -g -o as9  as9.c

Limitations:

1) This does not support macros (use M4, etc.).  
2) Symbols are 8 characters only with a max of about 2000 
   (this could be changed int he code).
2) This does not support complex math expressions such as:

   AAA EQU   100
   BBB EQU   (AAA*2)/2

This would have to be split into:

   AAA EQU   100
   TTT EQU   AAA*2
   BBB EQU   TTT/2

There may be a more recent one.  If so, I will probably incorporate 
my mods and release it again.  

Motorola ftp should be at:

   freeware.aus.sps.mot.com

I have not been able to access it (as of yet). 
The phone number for the BBS is:

   512-891-3733.

Note:  There are assemblers for the 6800,1,2,4,5,8,9,11... based on
this code.  I may try to make all of them and release the entire lot
as a package (when I find the *&^% time).  Any volunteers?
