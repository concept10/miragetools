<h1>F9DASM - 6809 / 6309 Disassembler</h1>

<p>Based on Arto Salmi's C core that can be found somewhere on the 'net 
(last address known to me was
<a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/~atjs/mc6809/Assembler/A09.c">
http://koti.mbnet.fi/~atjs/mc6809/Assembler/A09.c</a>),
I built a complete 6809/6309 disassembler that can handle input files
in a variety of formats (Intel Hex / Motorola S09 / Flex9 Binary / Binary).
Since disassembly without guidance produces measly results, it can load
information files with quite a lot of directives, too.</p>

<p>I taylored the original to my taste by working through the source code; since 
F9DASM has reached a level of complexity that doesn't really lend itself to following the &quot;Use 
the Source, Luke!&quot; principle if you just want to disassemble a little 6809 
program, I've added this documentation. Have fun!</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>f9dasm [-option]* filename</pre>

<h3>Command Line Options</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><b>-begin <i>address</i></b></dt>
  <dd>start disassembly address (<i>address</i> has to be given in hex format)<br>
      When disassembling a binary file, the default load address
	  is 0, since the binary file does not contain any clues; using this
	  option forces F9DASM to load the file at the specified address.</dd>
